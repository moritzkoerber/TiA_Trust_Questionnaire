# Trust in Automation Questionnaire (TiA)

This is the repository for the "Trust in Automation" (TiA) questionnaire (German: "Fragebogen Vertrauen in Automation") by Moritz Körber. The questionnaire is available in **German** (`Vertrauen-in-Automation_TiA_Fragebogen.pdf`) and **English** (`Trust-in-Automation_TiA_questionnaire.pdf`). The questionnaire's **German and English manuals** are located in `1_manual/`. Feel free to ask any questions you may have in the repo's discussion section.

## Future Work

Feel free to develop the questionnaire further. Körber (2019) lists some potential objectives for future work. These include, besides gathering more data on the questionnaire’s psychometric quality, an examination of the questionnaire’s theoretical model and measurement model (e.g. if a total score is meaningful) by a structural equation model. Also, the English version of the questionnaire needs to be validated.

Furthermore, the benefit of a revision of the subscale *Trust in Automation* could be investigated (Körber, 2018). Mayer and Davis (1999) use a four-item scale to assess trust in their model of interpersonal trust. The items are less direct than the two items of the TiA questionnaire and rather aim at the willingness to be vulnerable, which is closer to the definition of trust in automation by Körber et al. (2018). A revised version of the TiA questionnaire may adopt this approach and offer multiple items for the subscale *Trust in Automation* that are closer to its definition. 

A revision may also reconsider the inclusion of the scale *Familiarity*. In the theoretical model, familiarity itself is not considered to be an element of trust in automation but indirectly influences it as a moderator. This moderating role needs to be confirmed. In the same manner, the inclusion of the subscale *Intention of the developers* must be reviewed since no factor could be extracted for this subscale in the initial factor analysis in Körber (2019). Depending on the results, researchers could eliminate up to both scales to shorten the questionnaire and may focus their future work on a “core questionnaire”.
